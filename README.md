![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/scristalli/sql-developer-keepalive/total)

## What is this?
You know when you are working in SQL Developer, and you have to reconnect because your connection has been terminated?
Pretty annoying, right?  
This extension solves your problem! By sending a simple query to the database every _n_ seconds, it keeps your connection alive.

## How do I install it?
Just download the latest release: [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/scristalli/sql-developer-keepalive)](https://github.com/scristalli/sql-developer-keepalive/releases)  
It comes as a ZIP, which you can simply install in SQL Developer with the menu _Help > Check for Updates_.  
After restarting SQL developer, click the first icon from the right to start using the keepalive.

Something is not clear? Read two sections ahead ;)

## Why did you make this?
The community wanted this. I started from [MinChen Chai's extension for SQL Developer 3](https://sites.google.com/site/keepaliveext/) and ported it to the OSGi framework used from version 4.

It is, and released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/scristalli/sql-developer-keepalive/blob/master/LICENSE).
